# Codeigniter User Library 
This library is a **very simple** user auth library for Codeigniter. If you're looking into more complex and secure, this is not for you.
The library works by simple passwords md5 hashing with some functions that can help you out.
I'll adding things to it as I need em. Fell free to request a pull.

## Quick Start

* Import the _userschema.sql_ to your database. It will creates 3 tables that contains the user, permissions and the linktable.
* After that, merge the content of this rep and merge with you Codeigniter root. It will add the library on your /application/library/ dir.
* If you like, you can see the demo that is included with this library. It contains a simple login and private page for you to get started.

## Documentation

I still working on a good documentation for the project, it will be released soon. Thanks.
